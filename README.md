The code has been adapted and added to by myself from Appendix S1 of the paper by Zipkin E.F et al. (2010). I have changed loops that could have been cleaner in their work and I've simulated the graphs to show their results. The graphs weren't included in the Appendix S1 but were shown in the paper to add to the discussion. I have illustrated the graphs over a larger time step than 6 weeks so we can see more and to further illustrate that their conclusions are legit. I have included detailed comments so I can demonstrate I know and understand what has been used in the code to get the results. 
The code includes: 
The probabilities of infection for the first time and an infected individual first recovers between the m-1 and m time steps is calculated
The expected duration of susceptible and infected states have been calculated
Simulated graphs of 1. the probability that susceptible house finches first become infected with MG and the probability that infected house finches recover and 2. the cumulative probability that a susceptible individual has been infected and an infected individual has recovered
Building on what we can see in the graphs, we then show for each year what the life expectancy is for the susceptible and infected individuals is based on work presented in the paper
